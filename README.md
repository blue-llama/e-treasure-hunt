# Ways to run
You can either run this app hosted (on Heroku) or locally. 
This branch should be up-to-date with master, and allow you to run locally. If you want to use Heroku, see the README on master.

You do not need to use Google Maps. If you choose not to, an alternate map is available which uses Leaflet and OpenStreetMap.

# How to run locally
## Prerequisites
- Dropbox account, with an app set up with read/write permission to a specific folder to hold the level images, and a corresponding OAuth key
- [ArcGIS for Developers account](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/plans) - this is a condition of use of the esri-leaflet-geocoder package and the underlying ArcGIS geocoding Api, used by the Alt Map. Use of this API is subject to terms and conditions, although it is currently free for low usage rates - see [Terms](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-geocoder#terms-and-conditions) and [Cost](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet-geocoder#cost) in the esri-leaflet-geocoder project, as well as the ArcGIS website. 
- If you are using Google Maps: Google Cloud account with Places and Maps JavaScript APIs enabled, and API key - ***NOTE: this API key is passed to clients, so you must ensure you have appropriate usage limits configured to avoid being charged if it is mis-used. You may also wish to employ additional security measures e.g. configuring an allowed redirect URI.***

## Setup
- Set the DJ_KEY environment variable to a secret string
- Set the DB_TOKEN environment variable to your DropBox OAuth token
- If you are using Google Maps: Set the GM_API_KEY environment variable to your Google API key
- Use pip/ virtualenv to install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Deploy
- Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to collect static files
- Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply migrations
- Run `python manage.py createsuperuser` and create an admin
- Run `python manage.py runserver` to run the server

## Initiating the app
### Admin initiation
- Navigate to localhost/admin
- Create a HuntInfo object for the admin user - set hints displayed to 5
- Create an AppSetting object - tick "active" and set next hint release to now; if you are NOT using Google Maps, tick "use alternate map"
- Create HintTime objects for all required hint release windows

### Create levels
- You can use the content of dummy_files.zip as a template
- about.json contains the name and location for the level (the name is displayed on the *next* level page, so can be the location) - tolerance is in meters
- blurb.txt contains the description for the level (displayed on the next level page)
- clue.png is the first image - the dummy file contains a background
- hint1.png-hint4.png are the hints, in order - you can use the background from the clue file

### Level upload
- Navigate to localhost/mgmt
- Upload a dummy level 0 using the dummy level files - replace blurb.txt and the level name in about.json with text for the start of the hunt
- Upload levels 1-N of the hunt
- Upload a dummy level N+1 using the dummy level files - replace clue with an image for the final page
- Navigate to localhost/home and check your level(s) display correctly

### Create users
- Add a User object via localhost/admin
- Add a HuntInfo object for each user with default values
- Pass the username and password to the teams and they can begin the hunt!
